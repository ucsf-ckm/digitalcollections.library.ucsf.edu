      <p class="style1">You can zoom in or out on each page. After zooming, you can click-drag the book to move it around the screen. The reset button will return the book to its original size and position.</p>
      <p class="style1"> Throughout the book there are handwritten notes. Some of these notes are very complex and may have writing on both sides of the paper or have multiple pieces of paper pasted and folded together. On these pages, you'll see an <img src="other_images/note.jpg" alt="Note" width="25" height="23" align="absmiddle" />. When you click the icon, the complex note will appear in a pop-up window. If the note has more then one page, please use the arrows on the navigation bar to move from one page to the next. The notes pages are displayed at a fixed width and if you enlarge, you simply need to click-drag  the note to adjust the view. The quality of each note in the actual book varies by paper and ink quality as well as the size of the handwriting.</p>
    <p class="style1">As an aside, the actual book has an interleaf between each set of pages. In many cases, there were no notations on the interleaf and we opted not to include those blank pages in this digital copy in hopes that the book may load faster without the additional files. </p></td>
